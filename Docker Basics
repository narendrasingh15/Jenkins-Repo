Docker is a tool that is used to create run and manage applications with the help of Containers.
Container is a running instance of Docker images and docker image is an immutable/frozen file created using Docker file(a text file used to create Docker Image).

In Case of Virtualization each Virtual machine runs its own Operating System with the allocated resources (CPU and RAM) and environment provided by Hypervisor.
Advantage is complete separation from host. Disadvantage is you need to allocate fix amount of resources for each VM and hypervisor eats up some resources too.

Containerization allows us to run application in an isolated partition on top of single Linux Kernel running on Host hardware.
Advantage is high performance since no Hypervisor is involved and container can use the higher amount of resources it needs.

1. docker --version
2. Run a docker container
docker run -d -p 80:80 --name webserver nginx
3. See running containers
docker ps    
4. See all containers
docker ps -a
5. Docker stop start commands
docker stop name
docker start name
6. Delete a container
docker rm -f name
7. See docker images
docker images
8. Remove images
docker rmi images (Can use -f too if forcefully)
9. Pull images from dockerhub
docker pull nginx
10. Pull specific version
docker pull nginx:1.10.3
11. Search Images on dockerhub
docker search nginx
12. Run docker containers
docker run nginx
docker run -d ngnix
13. To get information about container
docker inspect container_id
14. Structure of Dockerfile
============
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80
WORKDIR /var/www/html/
RUN ls -lhrt /var/www/html/
CMD ["nginx", "-g"]
=============
15. Build a Docker Image 
docker build -t static-app .
16. Check logs
docker logs container_name
